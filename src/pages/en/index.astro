    <CareerInfoSection>
      <p>I started my career as a Web designer, not as an engineer.</p>
      <p>I changed my job as an engineer to concentrate on programming because I thought that I could not understand the basics of what I could and could not do on the browser and could not make expressions and feature proposals that would be pleasing to users, rather than the influence of my previous career when I was in charge of all direction-design programming.</p>
      <p>I began my career as a markup engineer, taking basic coding and gradually moving into the frontend engineer space, including jQuery, Ajax communication, task runners, CSS design, and the use of frameworks.</p>
      <p>Since joining a business company, I have been working on creating an environment that facilitates front-end development of monolithic server-side applications and eliminating technical debts. As a UI designer, I design UI using web technologies and check accessibility.</p>
