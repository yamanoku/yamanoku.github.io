    <CareerInfoSection>
      <p>I started my career as a Web designer, not as an engineer.</p>
      <p>
        I changed my job as an engineer to concentrate on programming because I
        thought that I could not understand the basics of what I could and could
        not do on the browser and could not make expressions and feature
        proposals that would be pleasing to users, rather than the influence of
        my previous career when I was in charge of all direction-design
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my career as a markup engineer, taking basic coding and
        gradually moving into the frontend engineer space, including jQuery,
        Ajax communication, task runners, CSS design, and the use of frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since joining a business company, I have been working on creating an
        environment that facilitates front-end development of monolithic
        server-side applications and eliminating technical debts. As a UI
        designer, I design UI using web technologies and check accessibility.

        I utilize <a href="https://scrapbox.io/">Helpfeel Cosense</a> to compile daily events
        and interesting news in the form of a journal. Rather than updating daily,
        I post whenever inspiration strikes.
