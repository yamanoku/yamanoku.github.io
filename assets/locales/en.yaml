  desc01: "I started my career as a Web designer, not as an engineer."
  desc02: "I changed my job as an engineer to concentrate on programming because I thought that I could not understand the basics of what I could and could not do on the browser and could not make expressions and feature proposals that would be pleasing to users, rather than the influence of my previous career when I was in charge of all direction-design programming."
  desc03: "I began my career as a markup engineer, taking basic coding and gradually moving into the frontend engineer space, including jQuery, Ajax communication, task runners, CSS design, and the use of frameworks."

  description:
    wafb: "Presented in the 5th technical book fest. I would like to ask not only engineers but also all people involved with the web to see what kind of measures are available for web accessibility, such as machine-readable web pages, human-readable web pages, and WAI-ARIA web pages."
    reading: "I came up with the idea of accumulating and visualizing information about what would happen if I collected and summarized the news that I always watch. It incorporates PWA technology so that it can also be viewed as an offline application."
    vuePortfolio: "Portfolio template made by Vue.js. This is the first SPA created from vue cli. I used the Vue 1.0 versions at first, but now I can upgrade it to the Vue 3.0 versions."
    vueA11yPage2019: "Created with the motivation to make people aware of accessibility in Vue.js development. Initially, I put together this article as a presentation for a conference, and then I presented it again as an article for the 2019 Web Accessibility Advent Calendar. There is a difference between when I wrote the article and the current information. Please be aware of this when browsing."
    oclock-app: "Using Svelte, a digital clock that can see up to the second in PWA. I make it possible to check any OS that can do Web browsing. It took about half a day to implement, including setup. Consideration is also given to screen readers using WAI-ARIA."
